1 it passed the rules i wanted to instal as a parameter rids
2 they were sent the update profile event from a rule triggered on child initialized event
3 i wrote it in json. makin 2 sensors and one of them made twice
    checking to see that there were only 2 and that they had ecis
    then i grab one of their profiles and matched against what it was suppoed to be
    then i sent 2 temperatures to each
    and then i grabbed one of their temperatures one of thier threshold violations and made sure they were the riight size
    and then test the grab all temps function in the manager
    then deleted 
    and made sure he was gone
4 the manager can make a chanel with the sensors and then give them to the children
